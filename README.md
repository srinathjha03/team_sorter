🏀 Fair Team Generator

A simple Python tool designed to solve the real-life problem of creating balanced sports teams for pickup games or PE classes.

🎯 Problem It Solves

In casual sports (football, basketball, volleyball), picking teams manually often leads to one side being much stronger than the other. This script uses a "Greedy Algorithm" to distribute skill evenly, ensuring a fair and competitive match.

🚀 How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed.

Download fair_teams.py.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the command:

python fair_teams.py


📝 Usage

Enter a player's Name.

Enter their Skill Level (1 to 10).

Repeat for all players.

Type done when finished adding players.

The program will instantly calculate and display two balanced teams (Team A and Team B) and show the total skill difference.

🧠 How it Works

Data Collection: The program collects a list of players and their skill ratings.

Sorting: It sorts all players from strongest to weakest.

Distribution: It iterates through the sorted list and assigns the next player to whichever team currently has the lower total skill score. This minimizes the skill gap between the two sides.
